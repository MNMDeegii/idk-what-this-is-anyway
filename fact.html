    <br><h4>Back in millions of years ago there is used to be giant bugs and one of them is giant Mosquito.</h4>
    <h4>There is possibilities that mosquitos found in tree resin could be containing blood of the extinct species which means we could get their DNA.</h4>
    <h4>But we can't possibly do this yet because we are lack of technology but in future who knows what would happen.</h4>
